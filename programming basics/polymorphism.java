     * Types of Polymorphism:
     * Static (compile time, specific method or function to be executed is determined by the compiler) 
     *  - Overloading: multiple methods with the same name but different Input Parameters, and thus subclasses can be distinguished by the input params
     * 
     * vs 
     * 
     * Dynamic (runtime, specific method or function to be executed is determined during the program's execution)
     *  - Overriding (subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass)
