Tensors, mathematical objects that can be used to describe physical properties, a generalization of scalars and vectors
- For a more in-depth 

Random Tensors: process of neural networks involve
Start with random numbers -> looking at data -> updating random numbers
-> look at data -> update numbers

Tensor datatypes (a key source of errors):
-> not right datatypes
-> not right shape
-> not right device

Data types in tensors: 
            32/64/16-floating point, 
            32/64/128-bit complex, 
            8/16/32/64-bit int,
            8/16/32/64-bit uint (unsigned integer),
            8/16/32-bit qint (quantized integer),
            8/16/32-bit quint (quantized unsigned integer),
            half (16-bit (half precision) floating-point), 
            bool,
            double,
            string,
            variant (arbitrary type),
