Primary keys in PostgreSQL:
=========================================================================
Uniqueness and Not Null: 
    A primary key enforces uniqueness and a NOT NULL constraint 
    on the specified column(s).

Column Order in Composite Primary Keys: 
    If you define a composite primary key (a primary key consisting of
    multiple columns), the order of columns in the primary key definition
    matters for the underlying index. The index will be created with the
    columns in the order you specify, which can impact the efficiency of 
    queries that filter on a subset of those columns.
